### 🤖<b>About the Project<b/><br/>
The AI Portfolio Agent is a Streamlit-based AI-powered chatbot that serves as an interactive portfolio. It leverages GPT to answer any questions about my background, education, work experience, and projects. Instead of browsing through a traditional portfolio, users can directly ask the AI agent about my qualifications, skills, and career journey.<br/>
